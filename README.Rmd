## Customized functions for my digital conetent analysis course

Here are some customized functions for the course I teach in the Spring Semester 2017 at the University of Zurich. For convenience I crated a small package. Will update continiously.

## How to install the package

- To install the Github version of the package:
  - Install devtools `if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")`
  - Start a new session, load devtools, and install socialsemR from Github.
  - `library(devtools)`
  - `install_github("adrauc/socialsemR")`
- Now you can load the library:
  - `library(socialsemR)`
- That's it, you can now use the functions in the package.

## How to use the package

Functions help for content analysis. Open automatically tweets, users, and posts on facebook:
```{r}
# for all functions: enter opens the next case, if you type quit and hit enter, it quits.

# to open a facebook user: input is a vector with user ids (strings):
open_user_fbaccount(comments_df[ ,"from_id"])

# to open a specific tweet: input is a df from the streamAPI:
open_tweet(tweets_df)

# to open a specific facebook post: input is a vector with post ids (strings) and the username from the url
open_facebook_post(facebook_posts_voice[ ,"id"], "TheVoiceOfGermany")

# to open a specific instagram picture: input is a data frame with the columns "id", "comments", and "likes":
open_pictures_insta(ensoie_df)


```
